# LL-OUNsicc 
This is a powershell script that facilitates the downloading of FLAC files from https://huzz.io/love-live/ while preserving their original filenames. 

# Legal Disclaimer 
I do not own any downloadable content nor their rights from the site where the script retrieves its FLAC files from. I am merely a fan who enjoys the Love Live! School Idol Project Series. If you enjoyed listening to the music, please support the Love Live! School Idol Project series and their voice actresses by purchasing their albums. They deserve all the support they can get, especially the newer groups who are just starting out! 

# How do I use the script to obtain all songs from Muse/Aqours/NijiGaku? 
1) Open the .ps1 file with Powershell ISE. 
2) Under #Variables, 
$DownloadFolder = "(Specify your desired school here)" 
within the open and close quotes "", change (Specify your desired school here) to Otonokizaka, Uranohoshi, Nijigasaki.
3) That's it! You're done. Run the script and enjoy! 

Downloading of the FLAC files will take some time and the speed is entirely dependant on your internet connection.
